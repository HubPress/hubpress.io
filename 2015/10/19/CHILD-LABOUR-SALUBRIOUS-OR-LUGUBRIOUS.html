<div class="paragraph">
<p>A young man commits a heinous crime with remorseless eyes and an unwavering heart. His lack of empathy sends a chill down the spines of onlookers. Now when society is about to cast him away for his vice, they fail to realize that they had already done so, many years ago, when they turned a blind eye to the evil of Child Labour which had so unsparingly convoluted this person’s heart and soul and his perceptions about society at large and communitarianism.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Constitution of India in the Fundamental Rights and the Directive of State Policy prohibits child labour below the age of 14 years in a hazardous environment. It had also envisioned that India shall, by 1960, provide infrastructure and resources for free and compulsory education to all children of the age 6-14 years. However, the 2001 National Census of India has another story to say; an estimated 12.6 million children, between the age group of 5-14, slog countless hours to earn a day’s worth of bread and butter. 120,000 of these were in a hazardous job. When facts and figures like these come to light, it is rather astonishing how the nation at large has failed to combat such an evil for so long.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Child Labour is still defined as the practice of having children engage in economic activity and not as a crime which deprives them of their childhood and hinders their physical and mental development. There is no historical record of when this practice actually originated but all we know for now is that it has currently found its way to almost every nook and cranny of our country. It is prevalent at every social and hierarchal level and yet nobody can answer as to why and how it’s there or provide a clear justification.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Apart from the general lack of awareness and the increasing need for money in poor families, it is the lack of efficient educational facilities at various strata that is the quintessential deterrent. While parents of such children use lack of income as an alibi, employers of such orphans use a more diplomatic and emotional rebuttal of having given “a chance[sic] to the poor fellow to continue living”. The lack of proper facilities and rehabilitation systems, puts these children in a ‘do or die’ situation. The social prejudices that the underprivileged people harbour was shockingly revealed when a survey found that they are more reluctant to spend on education for their daughters than their boys. In hindsight, such wayward mindsets and ideology questions the efficiency and relevance of our whole approach at tackling Child Labour.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When both sides of the story appear grey, we turn to the integral adjudicator for this topic, the government. Creating a ChildLine Helpline: 1098 and a ChildLine website: <a href="http://www.childlineindia.org.in/" class="bare">http://www.childlineindia.org.in/</a> is only helpful if almost 98% of the people are not oblivious of its existence. The ChildLine website has lesser functionality and appeal than popular e-shopping websites like Flipkart and Snapdeal which further goes on to reinforce that there has been a dearth of radical and heartfelt efforts from the government’s side.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One need not look far to see that NGO’s like Bachpan Bachao Andolan and CARE India have managed to bring about more change with a lesser budget. I look forward to a day when we can have a Big Brothers Big Sisters of India <a href="http://www.bbbs.org/" class="bare">http://www.bbbs.org/</a> , a non-profit organization whose goal is to help all children reach their potential through professionally supported, one-to-one relationships with volunteering mentors.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In my opinion, that would be the first and last step we need ever take to end Child Labour.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However much we contemplate, in the end it all comes down to the actions we carry out and the ever burning human will and passion. A small change from our side, a wishful thinking or a staunch policy of justice would soon bring about a radical reform and end this horrendous act. Just ask yourself if you know when the World Day against Child Labour is?</p>
