== From Up North

link:http://www.fromupnorth.com/[**From Up North**] is a "design blog focusing on promoting and inspiring cratives all over the world." Think of a Behance or a Dribble but more under the radar. A post I came across that I thoroughly enjoyed is "25 Greate Quotes to Inspire and Brighten Your Day" ( link:http://www.fromupnorth.com/great-quotes-549/[Find It Here] ) and they have a bunch more ways to find inspiration - from Web design to motion graphics to logos and typography. Check out the site and see what you fill be inspired by!
