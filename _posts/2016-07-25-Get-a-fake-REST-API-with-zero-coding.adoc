= Get a fake REST API with zero coding

When you are working on the frontend, sometimes you need to manipulate dynamic data.
A few months ago, I discover this great tool on Github https://github.com/typicode/json-server that allows simulating a fake REST API in your App in a few seconds.

After of download the dependencies through npm in your project folder, you need to create a `db.json` file with the content to use.

Example:
```bash
{
  "posts": [
    { "id": 1, "title": "json-server", "author": "typicode" }
  ],
  "comments": [
    { "id": 1, "body": "some comment", "postId": 1 }
  ],
  "profile": { "name": "typicode" }
}
```

The last step is run this command in your console:
```bash
$ json-server --watch db.json
```

Now if you go to http://localhost:3000/posts/1, you'll get:
```bash
{ "id": 1, "title": "json-server", "author": "typicode" }
```

I hope that this should be a help for you in future projects!

Happy coding!
