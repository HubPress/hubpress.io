= Why are all programming languages in English?
I have a few years working on this, but all the projects were I participate, all the code are written in English.

Out of 8500+ programming languages recorded, around 2400 of them were developed in the United States, 600 in the United Kingdom, 160 in Canada, and 75 in Australia. In other words, over a third of all programming languages were developed in a country that primarily speaks English. It's the main cause that the English language is used in great part of the programming.

Another thing, it's English are the global language that we use to communicate to other people's.
