= Pure CSS Image Loader

Hi, everyone! On this opportunity, I'm sharing with you a little trick with only CSS to show your images with a progressive blur until the image has been loaded entirely. You can view this effect implemented on Medium or Instagram.

I recommend taking at look at the official documentation where you can find how the keyframes work: https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS/@keyframes

After of apply the rules on our CSS Stylesheets, the result is the following:

To understand better this, I create a repository on Github.

Ask in the comments if you have any questions.
