==== sub()

Change a value by another with sub.
We will rewrite the sentence in order to write the group1 followed by "pipou"

[source,python]
----
import re

test = "56test"

# this will replace the first group of the regex by pipou in test string 
print re.sub(r"([0-9]{2})([a-z]{4})", r"\g<1>pipou", test)

#>>'56pipou'
----

The same thing by compiling first : 

----
import re

test = "56test"

# this will replace the first group of the regex by pipou in test string 
regex = re.compile(r"([0-9]{2})([a-z]{4})")
print regex.sub(r"\g<1>pipou", test)

#>>'56pipou'
----
