==== sub()

Change a value by another with sub.
We will rewrite the sentence in order to write the group1 followed by "pipou"

[source,python]
----
import re

test = "56test"

# this will replace the first group of the regex by pipou in test string 
print re.sub(r"([0-9]{2})([a-z]{4})", r"\g<1>pipou", test)

#>>'56pipou'
----

The same thing by compiling first : 

[source,python]
----
import re

test = "56test"

# this will replace the first group of the regex by pipou in test string 
regex = re.compile(r"([0-9]{2})([a-z]{4})")
print regex.sub(r"\g<1>pipou", test)

#>>'56pipou'
----

==== change stuff in a file with regex 

Example - changing the number 183200 of the first line to 201600 in multiples files containing multiple texts like this


WSCI31 RCTP 183200
RCAA SIGMET 2 VALID 190500/190900 RCTP-
RCAA TAIPEI FIR EMBD TS FCST
WI N2630 E11730 - N2800 E12400 - N2400 E12400 - N2500 E11730
TOP FL410 MOV E 10KT NC

for sigmet in file_list:

    f = open(file_name, "r")
    content = f.read()
    new_content = regex.sub(r"\1 \3 " + new_date + r"\n", content)
    f.close()

    f = open(file_name, "w")

    f.close()
