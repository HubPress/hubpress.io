# Windows Server 2012 R2 Remote Desktop Connection error on Mac

:hp-tags: Windows Server, RDC, Mac

I recently faced an issue trying a remote connection to a `Windows Server 2012 R2` using `Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection Client for Mac`. It's the application is bundled with `Microsoft Office for Mac 2011` suite.

The following error shows up:
____
Remote Desktop Connection cannot verify the identity of the computer that you want to connect to.

Try reconnecting to the Windows-based computer, or contact our administrator.

I double-checked the server settings, try connecting using the Windows 8.1 `Remote Desktop Connection` client, everything worked as expected. So the problem was clearly related to my Mac or the RDC client.

Iâ€™ve headed to the download page of `Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection Client for Mac` where there are the supported operating systems:

* Windows Vista Business
* Windows Vista Enterprise
* Windows Vista Ultimate
* Windows XP Professional
* Windows XP Media Center
* Windows Server 2008 Datacenter
* Windows Server 2008 Enterprise
* Windows Server 2008 Standard
* Windows Server 2003 Datacenter
* Windows Server 2003 Enterprise
* Windows Server 2003 Standard

As you can see `Windows Server 2012 R2` is not in the list. To fix this error, you need to download the latest `Microsoft Remote Desktop` app available on the link:https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id715768417[Mac App Store].
