= Removing and Adding Classes on Javascript
The classList JavaScript property ships with four methods that allow us to add, remove, toggle, and check for classes easily with plain JavaScript.

Adding and removing classes has to be one of the most common tasks when it comes to JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

###### Element.classList
The classList property returns a token list of the class attribute of the element
It comes with a few handy methods:

* add - adds a class
* remove - removes a class
* toggle - toggles a class
* contains - checks if a class exists

###### Demo Example
To understand better this, I create on Codepen a simple example to show you how this works: http://codepen.io/StrengthandFreedom/pen/ZOGVLg/
