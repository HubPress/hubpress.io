= the speed of dreaming vs. the speed of execution

:hp-tags: meta, tempus_fugit

There is opening an ever wider gap between the speed of my dreaming up new ideas and concepts and the my speed of executing on them. I've come, reluctantly, to the realisation that this might be a function of age. 

But maybe I should start at the beginning. Over the last weeks I have reorganised my notes and my tagging system. This took a *lot* longer than anticipated. Also, I stumbled across some notes I had completely forgotten about. Ok, this gave me the brief pleasure of finding some of them quite clever. But I had thought so once before and nothing much had happened.

_A memory like a wossname, bowl with holes._

Not too long ago, or so my memory claims, I had the idea and brought it to a usable state quickly. Today I seem to struggle to come up with a "Shitty Draft". 

Hopefully this is a midlife crisis, because then I'll live on to the ripe age of 110.
