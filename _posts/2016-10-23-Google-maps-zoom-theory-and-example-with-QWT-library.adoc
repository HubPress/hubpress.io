= Google maps zoom theory and example with QWT library


===== Theory

Recently I had to set up a zoom on qwt plot, the goal was to get the same zoom as google maps when zooming on some coordinates. 

qwt plot example :

Open maps and test, put your cursor on a city and zoom, all the map will be zoomed but the city will always be under your cursor. 

The solution is easy the main idea is to reset your scales with a factor (ex : 0.9 or 1.1) and to apply a part of the factor by using the position of the cursor in order to get the zoom or unzoom. 

We will assume that the x axis is the horizontal and y the vertical.
So if we want to zoom on the point which is at (1, 2.5)  [(x, y)] we will

- get the position of our cursor on the widget (x_cursor, y_cursor)
- define the percentage (x_max, y_max) which are the percentage of the x_cursor position and the x_cursor_max position (size max of the widget) and the same for y_percent with y_cursor and y_cursor_max.
- we will compute the new x scale with x_percent of the factor on a side and 100 - x_percent of the factor for the other side and do the same for the y scale with y_percent / the factor.

After processing all of this we will have the x axis scale [0.2, 4] and the y axis scale [0.4, 8.5].
