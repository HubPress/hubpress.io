= First post... Let's start!

This is the first post of my new blog. There are a series of tasks I want to accomplish in this month of October 2015:

 - Setup a home NAS.
 - Migrate all the content of the server where manelvf.com is hosted (Amazon AWS) to the NAS, Github pages or a different server (take care of the VPN info also).
 - Setup a new server using that hosts different applications using Docker and maybe other tools.
 
Hubpress is really cool as a blog system. The preview is a killer feature. Also, having a static blog with live editing included is clearly "best of both worlds". Let's see how this works with more stuff.
