# AppImage helps making cross disto Linux apps a reality 

Whenever we see that an app is available for Linux on a website, we see it packed for multiple distributions, unlike a single binary for Windows & Mac. This is obvious. Since different distributions have different package managers to install & maintain apps. 
  
There were many attempts made to provide apps which could run on multiple Linux distros in the past & even now. One of the succesful ways to deliver such apps is the AppImage <http://AppImage.org> which relies on concept of *1 app = 1  file.* 

## Key features of AppImage 
* Runs on all major Linux distros like Ubuntu, mint, Debian, arch, open suse.
* No root permissions required to run the apps without compromising system's security. 
* Apps are compressed all the time which saves disk space unlike traditional installation. 
* Apps can be portable. Can be carried on pendrive, memory cards etc since they run without any installation. 
* AppImages implements delta updates in which updates directly come from the software developer without waiting to get added in the the distribution repo's. Delta update also drastically saves bandwidth since a small portion required in the app can be updated without updating the whole app.

In fact, this is not an new project. It's been there since a long time under the name of portablelinuxapps. Even Linus Torvalds was happy with this project. https://plus.google.com/+LinusTorvalds/posts/WyrATKUnmrS

That's not all. If you have some level of technical knowledge, you could also make AppImage of your favourite apps & share it with the world.
