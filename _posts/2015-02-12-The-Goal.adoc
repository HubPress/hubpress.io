= The Goal


*Over the next serveral months I will be using this blog to record my progress on implementing NetBSD rump kernels into the Composite operating system.*

== Composite?

Composite is a component based OS that has been under development since 2008. It currently serves as a research tool at the George Washington University but will eventually hold real world applicability.  

*Research / Development Goals:*

* Parallelism
* Reliability
* Security
* All for impeded devices
