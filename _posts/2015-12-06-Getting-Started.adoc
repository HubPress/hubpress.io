= Getting Started

I just installed http://hubpress.io/[HubPress] on my github pages site. It was dead simple.

It uses http://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc] rather than https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/[MarkDown] and I'm a little intimidated by that. The syntax for AsciiDoc is much more complicated than Markdown so I have alot to learn. The upside to this is that AsciiDoc is much more powerful.
