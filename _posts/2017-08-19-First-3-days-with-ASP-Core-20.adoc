= First 3 days with ASP Core 2.0

About 3 days ago the final version of ASP Core released. I installed the new bits and have been playing with it for last 3 days and here is my experience so far. Fantastic.

=== No bugs
So far I expericed no bugs. Everything works perfectly. No compatiblity issues like the preview version and no errors. Its fast and reliable.

=== .Net Stanard 2.0
Its realy the best part of the new version. it feels so more matured than the last version. supporting a larg number of older libararies is really what many developers were looking for.

=== Configuarion and Logging as a service
With IConfiguration And ILoggerFactory injected directly into Services
its now accessible from every where in project without any additional code. 

=== Razor pages
I always needed this feature. In very projects there is some simple pages that dont have any code behind. And even they do, its almost nothing. now I dont have to create a Model, Controller and View just to show about page. and thats my favorite thing in ASP Core 2.0

=== Conclusion
