= Unsung App of the Week
:hp-tags: Apps, Android
:hp-image: one_main_app.JPG


An app that I came across by chance has turned out to be one of my new favorites for this past week - welome **One**. Built by the Pomotodo Team, **One** is "One App to read them all." **One** combines the top stories from _Hacker News_, _Reddit_, _Product Hunt_, _Slashdot_, _Designer News_, _Github_, _Medium_, and _Readability Top Reads_ into a single, well designed app. It is available as a Mac menu bar app, iOS, and Android. Be sure to check it out if you want to keep up with all your news!
