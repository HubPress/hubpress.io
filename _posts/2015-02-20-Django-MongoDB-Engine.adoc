= Django MongoDB Engine

== Installation

Django MongoDB Engine depends on

* Django-nonrel, a fork of Django that adds support for non-relational databases.
* djangotoolbox, a bunch of utilities for non-relational Django applications and backends.

Itâ€™s highly recommended (although not required) to use a virtualenv for your project to not mess up other Django setups.
