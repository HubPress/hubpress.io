# How to create Middleware in ASP Core ?
:hp-tags: ASP.NET,Core,Middleware

One of the best features of ASP.NET Core is its flexible pipeline. You can control what goes into your applications pipeline and add more to it using a *Middleware*.

#### SendFile Middleware
This middleware is just a sample project to see how middlewares are created in ASP.NET Core. I tried it keep is simple as possible,after all this is my first middleware.

#### What it does?
You set a file path at startup and SendFile Middleware sends it back to user in browser. 

[source,c#]
public class Startup
    {
        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
        {
            if (env.IsDevelopment())
            {
                app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
            }
            app.UseSendFile(@"C:\myfile.jpg");
        }
    }

It can be any kind of file, and user receives it in browser.

#### SendFile middleware explained
The basic parts of a middleware in ASP.NET Core is simple. You have to create a class like this : 

[source,C#]
internal class SendFileMiddleware
    {
        private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
        private readonly SendFileMiddlewareOptions _options;
        public SendFileMiddleware(RequestDelegate next,
        IOptions<SendFileMiddlewareOptions> options)
        {
            _options = options.Value;
            _next = next;
        }
        public Task Invoke(HttpContext context)
        {
            if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(_options.FilePath))
            {
            var file = new Microsoft.Extensions.FileProviders.Physical.PhysicalFileInfo(
                    new System.IO.FileInfo(_options.FilePath));
                context.Response.SendFileAsync(file);
            }
            return this._next(context);
        }
    }
    
As you can see there is no inheritance involved. You just to provide a structure. the **_next** property is a request delegate that you use to pass the reponse to next middleware. and there is an **options** parameter. if you want to pass data to your middleware you need an **IOptions** interface. Next there is the **Invoke** method. it takes a HttpContext and creates the response then you pass the response to next middleware. you dont have to pass if your middleware is a short-circuit one.

[source,C#]

namespace Codehaks.Middlewares.SendFile
{
    public class SendFileMiddlewareOptions
    {
        public string FilePath { get; set; }
    }
}

#### The extention method
The best way to present your middleware is to create an Extention method and give other developer the option to call it directly with IApplication parameter.

[source,C#]

public static class SendFileMiddlewareExtension
    {
        public static IApplicationBuilder UseSendFile(
            this IApplicationBuilder builder, SendFileMiddlewareOptions options)
        {
            return
            builder.UseMiddleware<SendFileMiddleware>(Options.Create(options));
        }
        public static IApplicationBuilder UseSendFile(
            this IApplicationBuilder builder, string filePath)
        {
            var options = new SendFileMiddlewareOptions()
            {
                FilePath = filePath
            };
            return
            builder.UseMiddleware<SendFileMiddleware>(Options.Create(options));
        }
    }

#### conclusion
Middlewares can solve many problems,Creating them is fairly easy and working with them is fun. But there are many things to watch for. Like when you change response it the pipeline the next middleware is not allowed to chat it again,there are some reasons for that. but thats the topic for an other post.

and also SendFile middleware is availbe at nuget : 

[source,C#]
**PM > Install-Package Codehaks.Middlewares.SendFile**
