= Defining media queries between two widths

If you are development a responsive website, it's probably that you need to define some media queries to show correctly your elements.
When you like to define a media query in a range, you can use the following code:

```
/* No greater than 768px, no less than 400px */
@media (max-width:768px) and (min-width:400px) {
    .class {
        font-size: 15px;
    }
}
```

I hope that this be useful.
