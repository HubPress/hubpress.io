This is a weekly update from the KubeVirt team.

We are currently driven by

- Being easier to be used on Kubernetes and OpenShift
- Enabling people to contribute

This week we was really slow, but we still achieved to:

- Improve vagrant setup (@cynepco3hahue)

In addition to this, we are also working on:

- GlusterFS support (@humblec)
