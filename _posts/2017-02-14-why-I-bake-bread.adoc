= ... why I bake bread

:hp-tags: bread

== background

About 10 years ago, or so, my daughter needed to avoid certain foods for 6 months. One of the foods was wheat. To make it easier to do, I started to bake spelt bread trying to aproximate toast.

This worked well.

* The daughter liked her father baking break for her, and it tasted good
* I discovered that I liked baking bread
** A reasonably fast result for your labour
** Not a huge investment in time
** A limited number of variables to tweak, a nearly unlimited amount of outcomes

Then, the six months were over.

== ever onwards

There I was, with a severe baking habit, needing a new outlet.

I started reading about baking and the beginnings of a "philosophy" developed.

I wanted to bake a bread that any family footnote:[in the Rhineland] within the last 1000 years could have baked.

To me that meant:
* Sourdough as a starter
* Spelt and rye footnote:[wheat came later]
* hand kneading
* large loafs (ca. 3kg)

Let's take them in turns.

=== sourdough

Sourdough speaks to my nerdy, geeky side, but in a good way. Making sourdough is easy. Basically you mix flour and water. Starting from there, there is a lot of ways to add complexity, leading up to arduino or raspberry pi controlled climate chambers for the dough.

But, as I was going into the direction of home baked bread, as it could have been done a 1000 years ago, an arduino was out of the question. I needed something more robust. footnote:[My job requires me leaving home on a monday morning, returning on a friday afternoon] So my sourdough starter lived in the fridge over the week, was "woken" with feedings friday night, saturday morning and saturday evening.

=== flour

Clearly 1000 years ago they would have had no white flour as today, but something shifted much more into the direction of wholemeal flour. I mixed spelt type 1050 and rye type 1150 flour for a good mix of authenticity and modern taste.

=== hand kneading

Of course

=== large loafs

A large loaf does not need that much more work, but keeps much better. In my experience, if stored outside the fridge, easily one to two weeks.

== original process

* wake up sourdough starter friday evening with 3 feedings
* mix flour with part of the water on saturday morning (sponge)
* mix sponge with sourdough starter, salt and the balance of water
* after an hour knead for 15 to 20 minutes
* after proofing form the loaf
* wait until loaf has proofed and put into oven

== what hapened in the oven?

Fairly early in my baking career I found the several articles and books extolling the uses of a dutch oven footnote:[a name which strikes me, as a Rhinelander, as fairly funny] in baking bread. So, I use a dutch oven, on a baking stone, in an oven pre-heated to the max.

== who ate all that bread?

Once novelty wore off, mixed with different "phases" of the kids development through puberty, I went from a weekly to a bi-weekly bake. After about 2 years I had to stop the regular baking and so, also the baking with sourdough.
