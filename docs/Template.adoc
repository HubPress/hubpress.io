= Blog Post Title
////
This is an AsciiDoc Comment. You can't see these in the published output, but they will help you understand the critical parts of a HubPress Blog Post.
////
////
All these tags are optional - delete them if you do not need them
////

:hp-tags: First Tag, Second Tag, Third Tag
:hp-cover: _[link to the cover image for the blog post]_
:published_at: YYYY-MM-DD

Each heading -- no matter the level -- must have one line of whitespace separating the title.

== First Heading
////
Click on the *Show/Hide Live Preview* (the eye icon)  to see this post in rendered view. Notice how this heading is auto-numbered `1.`. That's because two equals characters tell AsciiDoc to make a Chapter (or Level 1 Heading).
////

=== First Section
////
When you indent with three equals characters, this tells AsciiDoc that you want to begin a Section (or Level 2 Heading)
////

First Section Text
=== Lists
////
Lists are simple in AsciiDoc. You use full stops to start a numbered list, and asterix characters to start ordered lists
////

A list must have one line of white space separating the lead-in sentence and the start of the list:

. Number One
. Number Two
.. Sub-numbered list one
.. Sub-numbered list two
. Number Three
* Bullet One
* Bullet Two
** Sub-bullet One
** Sub-bullet Two

=== Images
////
The README.adoc covers this but in summary you can insert images by referencing them from a URL, or from your GitHub `/images` directory.

=== Tables
////
Tables can be complex to configure, but once you get it right, they look great in AsciiDoc. Separate each row with a pipe (|) symbol. You don't need to equally space out the colums either: the pipe takes care of columns for you.
////

==== Table Alternatives
////
You can use the `Labeled` mark up to make two column tables in list form. If you are familiar with XML, these are basically <variablelist> constructs.
