<p>It all started on a boring Wednesday when we stumbled upon a hackathon by Bosch on Hackerearth. It&#8217;s funny how boredom and ambition led to an amazing life experience.</p>

<p>The first round was the <em>Idea Stage</em>, only the <strong>top 30 ideas</strong> would be shortlisted to work on their project for 36 hours. This was our first hackathon and we didn&#8217;t sign up for the heck of it, we wanted to <strong>win</strong>. I had <em>Leap Motion</em> which I never got around to use and from there we started brainstorming. We decided to create a Virtual Reality experience with the <em>Leap</em> and <em>Google Cardboard</em>. But this was a hardware hackathon and we would definately not even be shortlisted. In our previous semester we built a robotic arm using an <em>Arduino</em> and a couple of Servos. Our idea was a robotic arm that could mimic hand gestures in realtime. <strong>Over 900 teams</strong> applied and we got through, now we had a month to learn and design our prototype.</p>
