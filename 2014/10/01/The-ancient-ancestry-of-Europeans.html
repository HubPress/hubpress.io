<p>Late summer in the English countryside is a hive of harvest activity. Anyone who&#8217;s been out and about in the past few weeks will have noticed the combine harvesters frantically transforming the fields of once-swaying stalks into lawns of stubble, punctuated with circular bales or tall stacks of hay. Such effort and gathering of agricultural produce is, of course, the basis of the autumnal harvest festival, and for hundreds of years has signalled the end of summer and the beginning of the slow and sober run in to winter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But for how long has our green and pleasant land been used in this way? The industrial expansion in the 18th and 19th centuries brought a new mechanised approach to farming that exponentially increased yields and, through the freeing up of agricultural labourers to the mills and mines, paved the way to rapid cultural and population growth. Prior to this revolution, it&#8217;s likely that the majority of British people worked the fields, ostensibly to provide for their families - and their feudal overlords - throughout the year, so it is true to say that agriculture is part of our, and indeed most societies', history.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One question that has concerned researchers from several different disciplines over the years is how farming came about in the first place, and how did it spread. Farming, or more generally, cultivation of our immediate environment, is thought to have independently emerged at least 7 times in human history, at least once independently in every continent of the world bar Antarctica. We know this through the use of different staple crops and domesticates in different societies across the world, but also because archaeologists have been able to trace and date the spread of technologies associated with farming - pots, farmsteads, metalwork - which differ markedly from those of the incumbent hunter-gatherers - spear-heads, stone tools, cave-paintings - and through the study of the relationships between the world&#8217;s languages. That the dominant mode of most societies on earth today is based on agriculture must be because once established, agriculture spread and out-competed the more primeval hunter-gatherer lifestyle.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Within Europe, we believe that the suite of agricultural traits that are common across the continent today, such as our staple crop wheat, and the use of sheep and goats, originated in the Middle East around 12,000 years ago at the beginning of a period known as the Neolithic. The spread from the Levant to north-western Europe took many thousands of years, but roughly speaking, by 4,000 years ago most of Britain was farming. Whilst this general idea is clear, there is still considerable debate as to how the Neolithic agricultural revolution actually happened. Did it involve the movement of 'pots or people'? Did the spreading farmers out-compete the hunter-gatherers on their way to European agricultural hegemony, or were they amalgamated into farming society?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One way to look further into this question is look at the DNA of people alive in Europe today. Can we establish the extent to which modern Europeans have farming - as opposed to hunter-gatherer - genetic ancestry? There have been a number of attempts to uncover the answer to this question, with varying success, but research had tended to flounder for one main reason: up until now, we did not know what ancient "hunter-gatherer" or "farmer" DNA looks like, so it&#8217;s difficult to work out how much of their DNA may be present in people today. This, however, is no longer the case. Researchers have, for the <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v513/n7518/full/nature13673.html">first time</a>, sequenced the DNA from both hunter-gatherers and farmers alive in Europe 8,000 years ago and compared it to the DNA from over 200 contemporary populations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The researchers sequenced the genomes of nine ancient people in total: a farmer from Luxembourg, a hunter-gatherer from Germany, and seven other hunter-gatherers from Sweden (although they concentrated on the first two individuals, as the DNA from the latter was less well preserved). The farmer&#8217;s genome was ancestrally related to present-day Middle Easterners - who also tended to have no hunter-gatherer ancestry – and is what you&#8217;d expect if people had moved to some extent with agricultural technology. Together with the genetic sequence of other hunter-gatherers, one from Siberia who lived 24,000 years ago and another from Iberia, they went about answering the question of to how much ancestry people alive in Europe today comes from farmers, and how much from hunter-gatherers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The work immediately threw up an unexpected result. In addition to the farmers and hunter-gatherers, there appeared to be a third distinct group of ancient people from whom Europeans derive ancestry. This group, dubbed the "Ancient North Eurasians", was likely to have been ancestral not only to all Europeans, but also to the Siberian hunter-gatherer - and to modern Native American populations - but not, intriguingly, to the ancient people dug up in Europe for this study. In addition to the ubiquitous Ancient North European ancestry, which is greatest today in north eastern Europeans, estimates of the amount of ancestry that different Europeans have from the other two groups show that Mediterranean populations have the highest level of farming ancestry, and populations from northern Europe have more hunter-gatherer ancestry.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Having DNA from people alive at a specific point in history can provide new insights into human evolution. For example, whilst both the hunter-gatherer from Germany and the farmer probably had brown hair, the hunter-gatherer probably had blue eyes and dark skin, and the farmer had brown eyes and light skin. Whilst it is tempting to think that lighter skin may have been associated with the spread of agriculture, interestingly, one of the hunter-gatherers sequenced from Sweden was also carrying a copy of the skin-lightening gene, so it must have been present in Europe before the farmers advanced.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is also possible to use the genetic relationships of these genomes to calibrate when different ancient people must have split from each other. Whilst all Europeans, ancient and modern, must have had a single common ancestor, the lineage that became the Luxembourg hunter-gatherer must have split off from the Ancient North European lineage before 24,000 years ago, the age that archaeologists have given to the Siberian hunter-gatherer, but after the split between Eurasians and east Asian aboriginal populations. Future work will enable further clarification of the key timings of the major human dispersals that led to the current spread of the world&#8217;s populations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, it&#8217;s becoming clearer that the advance of agriculture in Europe involved people as well as pots. However, the identification of a hitherto unknown group from northern Eurasia as ancestral to all modern Europeans throws up a number of future questions to explore, not least whether they have been identified in the archaeological record. Furthermore, by overturning the notion that Europeans are some mixture of just two different ancestral groups, this work also highlights the increasingly complex picture of human history that is being exposed by genomics.</p>
