== Getting Started

=== Fork the Repository

Click the Fork icon image:http://hubpress.io/img/fork-icon.png[Fork,80] to create a copy of this repository within your GitHub account.

=== Use the github.io Domain

If you have never used your GitHub Pages domain before, you can use this procedure to quickly set up HubPress. With this method, only a few steps are required to get HubPress deployed and ready for use.

IMPORTANT: If you are currently using your `username.github.io` GitHub Pages domain for another project, or if you want to use a custom domain name, skip to the next procedure for instructions.

. Rename your repository to `<username>.github.io`

. Set values in `hubpress/config.json`

* `username`, which is your GitHub user name,
* `repositoryName`, which is the new name of the repository fork, `<username>.github.io`.
. Commit the changes, and open the GitHub Pages domain:  `https://<username>.github.io/`.
. The following screen indicates you have correctly configured HubPress

=== Use a Custom Domain or GitHub Page Domain Already In Use

If you want your blog to be available on a custom domain, or you are already using your GitHub Pages domain to host another project, some extra configuration is required.

. In the repository settings, set the default branch to `gh-pages`:

. Set the required values in `hubpress/config.json
+
image:http://hubpress.io/img/edit-config-gh-pages.png[Edit config]
+
The following parameters are mandatory:
+
* `username`, which is your GitHub user name,
* `repositoryName`, which is the repository fork. For example, `hubpress.io` if you did not rename it.
. Commit the changes, and open the GitHub Pages domain:  `https://<username>.github.io/<repositoryName>/`.
. The following screen indicates you have correctly configured HubPress
+
